<h1>About Me </h1> 
<div style='text-align: justify;'>I am Ravi Kant Gupta, a doctoral candidate in the <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in" style="text-decoration: none;">Department of Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Indian Institute of  Technology, Bombay</a>. My research focuses to build end to end pipeline for medical solutions(diognosis) specialised for histology images of multiple organs for multiple computer vision tasks. I have been associated with MeDAL (Medical Imaging, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lab) and working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Amit Sethi</a>. I did my Masters in Control Systems from the Department of Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://www.nitkkr.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">National Institute of  Technology, Kurukshetra.</a> I was working in the <a href="http://www.nitkkr.in/control/" style="text-decoration: none;">Department of Electrical Engineering </a> under the supervision of <a href="[https://nitkkr.ac.in/author/sunita-chauhan/]" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Sunita Chouhan </a>, where I developed a simulation model for controlling a Robot manipulator using Fuzzy Logic and Genetic Algorithm. I have been serving as a reviewer for top international conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, EMVC, ICLR, BioImaging and WACV.</div>  
<p>  </p>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>After completing my Masters degree, I worked as Assistant Professor at <a href="https://vesit.ves.ac.in" style="text-decoration: none;"> VESIT ,Chembur, Mumbai <a>. Along with this i was working as faculty for training of competative exam like GATE <a href="https://vesit.ves.ac.in" style="text-decoration: none;"> and, IIT JEE <a href="https://vesit.ves.ac.in" style="text-decoration: none;"><a>. After working in academics for sometime, I moved back to academic research at the <a href="https://electrical.iitb.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Department of Electrical </a>, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay,Mumbai.  I did coursework in theoretical physics with special focus on Quantum Computing and Quantum Information. I did a 6 month Internship with the AI Camera Team, Camera Solutions Group, Visual Intelligence Division at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/sri-b" style="text-decoration: none;">Samsung R&D Institute India, Bangalore (SRI-B)</a> from July 2023 to January 2024. I worked on developing various models for tasks such a classification, detection and generation. These models have been commercialized and deployed in Samsung's flagship Galaxy S24 series.</div>

<br>I maintain a list of my publications under the Research tab and my full Resume is attached in the CV Tab.
