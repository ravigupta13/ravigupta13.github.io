<h1>About Me </h1> 
<div style='text-align: justify;'>I am Ravi Kant Gupta, a doctoral candidate in the <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in" style="text-decoration: none;">Department of Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Indian Institute of  Technology, Bombay</a>. My research focuses to build end to end pipeline for medical solutions(diognosis) specialised for histology images of multiple organs for multiple computer vision tasks. I have been associated with MeDAL (Medical Imaging, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lab) and working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Amit Sethi</a>. I did my Masters in Control Systems from the Department of Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://www.nitkkr.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">National Institute of  Technology, Kurukshetra.</a> I was working in the <a href="http://www.nitkkr.in/control/" style="text-decoration: none;">Department of Electrical Engineering </a> under the supervision of <a href="[https://nitkkr.ac.in/author/sunita-chauhan/]" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Sunita Chouhan </a>, where I developed a simulation model for controlling a Robot manipulator using Fuzzy Logic and Genetic Algorithm. I have been serving as a reviewer for top international conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, EMVC, ICLR, BioImaging and WACV.</div>  
<p>  </p>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>After completing my Masters degree, I worked as Assistant Professor at <a href="https://vesit.ves.ac.in" style="text-decoration: none;"> VESIT ,Chembur, Mumbai <a>. Apart from pure academics i have worked as faculty for competative exams like <a href="https://vesit.ves.ac.in">GATE</a> and <a href="https://vesit.ves.ac.in">IIT JEE</a> with well known classes of india.
. After working in academics for sometime, I moved back to academic research at the <a href="https://electrical.iitb.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Department of Electrical Engineering </a>,Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai. At IIT Bombay we are focused to investigate the real time computer vision problems with the AI/ML for Tata Memorial Center <a href="https://tmc.gov.in/" style="text-decoration: none;"> <a>, for various rare diseases such as Lung Cancer, Head & Neck Cancer and many more organ specific clinical difficulties. I worked on developing various models for tasks such a classification, detection and generation. These models have been commercialized and deployed in Samsung's flagship Galaxy S24 series.</div>

<br>I maintain a list of my publications under the Research tab and my full Resume is attached in the CV Tab.
