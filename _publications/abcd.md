This study introduces a novel method for WSI classification by automating the identification and examination of the most informative patches, thus eliminating the need to process the entire slide. Our method involves two-stages: firstly, it extracts only a few patches from the WSIs based on their pathological significance; and secondly, it employs Fisher vectors (FVs) for representing features extracted from these patches, which is known for its robustness in capturing fine-grained details. This approach not only accentuates key pathological features within the WSI representation but also significantly reduces computational overhead, thus making the process more efficient and scalable. We have rigorously evaluated the proposed method across multiple datasets to benchmark its performance against comprehensive WSI analysis and contemporary weakly-supervised learning methodologies. The empirical results indicate that our focused analysis of select patches, combined with Fisher vector representation, not only aligns with, but at times surpasses, the classification accuracy of standard practices. Moreover, this strategy notably diminishes computational load and resource expenditure, thereby establishing an efficient and precise framework for WSI analysis in the realm of digital pathology.
