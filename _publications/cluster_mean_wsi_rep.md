In this novel approach we addresses challenges with wsi by leveraging various encoders for intelligent data reduction and employing a different classification model to ensure robust, permutationinvariant representations of WSIs. A key innovation of our method is the ability to distill the complex information of an entire WSI into a single vector, effectively capturing the essential features needed for accurate analysis. This approach significantly enhances the computational efficiency of WSI analysis, enabling more accurate pathological assessments without the need for extensive computational resources. This breakthrough equips us with the capability to effectively address the challenges posed by large image resolutions in whole-slide imaging, paving the way for more scalable and effective utilization of WSIs in medical diagnostics and research, marking a significant advancement in the field.
